      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
            <p>The goal of this assignment was to redesign the desktop view of an ecommerce site in a 2-week design sprint, culminating with an interactive medium-fidelity prototype. I chose the Beach Grass Shop because Kennebunkport has personal meaning for me, and because the site seriously needs help.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <p> I began my inquiry by conducting contextual interviews. There were a few clear problems with the current site. Looking at the homepage, there was an ambiguous purpose of the site. People could not tell that it sold any products, and thought it might have been advertising a beach. Additionally, there was no search bar, and the navigation headings were misleading. For example, no one intuitively knew what "MISC" would include. Scrolling down the home page, there were three images below the hero image. These were unrecognizable as products sold by the store since they were unlabeled and uneven sizes. </p>
          </div>
          
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <a href="img/beachgrass/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-05%20at%204.24.42%20PM-min.png"><img src="img/beachgrass/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-05%20at%204.24.42%20PM-min.png" class="img-fluid m-x-auto d-block" style="max-height: 400px;"></a>
            </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
              <br>
              <p>
                Clicking on the products tab, the categories were ambiguously labeled and caused further confusion. During the contextual interviews, users could not identify what PostQuotes meant, or explain why certain products were included in the Holidays category. Clicking into one of the product categories (see second picture), there was also no sort or filtering capabilities.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
            <p>
              Now that I had identified problems with the site, I moved on to a competitor analysis. I looked at 6 other stores. I chose four online ecommerce stores and two boutique gift shops for comparison. The large retailers were uncommongoods.com, fab.com, personalcreations.com, etsy.com, and the small boutique stores were Gifted and Olives &amp; Grace.
            </p>
              <br>
              <p> I compared in detail how each site presented their homepages, product listings, and product view pages. I then pulled this information out in trends as displayed in the table below.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-12">
              <a href="img/beachgrass/comparison%20table.png"><img src="img/beachgrass/comparison%20table.png" class="img-fluid m-x-auto d-block" style="max-height: 400px;"> </a>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
            <p>To further explore the competitors, I then sketched the layouts of each page, highlighting for myself where certain features were located or missing. These features included search bar, user ratings, and suggested products. Below is an example of a few of my sketches.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-12">
              <a href="img/beachgrass/comparison%20layouts.png"><img src="img/beachgrass/comparison%20layouts.png" class="img-fluid m-x-auto d-block" style="max-height: 300px;"> </a>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
            <p> In addition to interviewing people about their gift-purchasing habits, I interviewed employees at gift shops and specialty retail stores, as well as one store manager. This gave me a deeper insight into how users shop for gifts, and learn about the pain points from a business perspective. From my user research and contextual interviews I was able to create an affinity map and define the problem statement:</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-xs-6">
              <a href="img/beachgrass/affinitymap.jpg"><img src="img/beachgrass/affinitymap.jpg" class="img-fluid m-x-auto d-block" style="max-height: 300px;"> </a>

          <div class="col-xs-6">
              <p class="lead m-x-auto" style="width: 80%; max-width: 700px;">
              As a boutique gift shopper, I want a way to easily search for items and browse the catalogue, so that I can have a small-store experience remotely.
                </p>
          </div> 
          
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
              <br>  
              <p> Before jumping into prototypes, I mapped out the <a href="img/beachgrass/User%20Flow.png">user flow </a>. I also created personas from my affinity map, plus a corresponding <a href="img/beachgrass/storyboard.jpg">storyboard </a> for one of the personas.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
              <p> I was now ready to start card sorting and organize the site map. Copying the successful competitors, I wanted the top navigation to have product categories listed out to draw the user in. I performed open and closed card sorting to define the final site map (first picture). Determining where to categorize "Calendars" proved to be the most difficult. Card sorting helped clarify that users considered it to be associated with post cards, reflecting back on their physical experience in bookstores. With these exercise completed, a newly organized site map was easily arranged (second picture).

              <p>The first round of usability tests were conducted with paper prototypes. I sketched out blocked layouts and tested the arrangement of features, and then worked up to a higher fidelity paper prototype.</p>

              <br>
              <p>After a round of testing the paper prototype, I noticed that the value of the brand was still not coming through clearly to the readers. I added a simple tag line to clarify the purpose of the brand. Additionally my design of the "write a review" page could be improved. Users wanted a way to quickly scan reviews and compare them, so I added a Pro- Con- section to improve scanability.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
              <p>The user testing with the digital product highlighted additional updates to the design. I added faded stars to ratings to add context that the ratings were out of five stars total. I also changed the verbiage on the price filter labels, so that it was distinguished from the language typically used in a sort.</p>

              <p>All of these changes were successful when I tested them in my digital prototype with InVision. In fact, one user liked the Pro- Con- list so much he said it would inspire him to write a review when he normally does not write reviews.</p>

          <p>The medium fidelity prototype proved to meet the user and business goals.

In addition, there was a tested Reviews &amp Rating section and a Suggested For You category.</p>
