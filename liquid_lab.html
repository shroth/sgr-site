            <p>This project was for my Visual Design class. The “client” was a new cold-pressed juice company targeting affluent, health-conscious individuals who wanted to supplement their diet with customized juice. I began by coming up with word associations for the company, Liquid Lab, and the customer. These word associations helped guide and gut-check each stage of the project. 
            </p>

              <p>
              After looking at competitors and noting trends to emulate and avoid, I created several mood boards. When I was deciding between the last two, I compared them to the list of words I had drawn up. I decided that one of the boards was too “pop” and young. The second board clearly communicated a fresh, natural feeling but with a more mature attitude. This more appropriately matched the tone that the client wanted to convey.

            <p>
              I ran through a similar exercise when comparing typography samples and color schemes. A clear sans-serif would be easy to read for the paragraph sections. I selected Tahoma. For headings I chose a font that had a hint of natural handwriting, so that the user would feel the customization that Liquid Lab offers. Seravek fit this description. For colors, orange and greens evoked the original ingredients for a natural aura. I chose web-safe colors which matched the hues presented in the mood board.

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
              <p>Two lo-fi wireframe options were tested, as well. They were color coded and compared to see which has the best contrast and most logical flow. There was clearly a superior design which also had the benefit of a smooth conversion into a mobile site.

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
            <p>Once the color scheme, typography, and wireframes were set, it was time to start working in Photoshop. I set up a basic four-column grid, with each row being the width of half a desktop button.

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-lg-4">
              <p>The biggest challenge was designing the survey. Radio buttons and checkboxes are simple, but boring. This survey was asking the user information about their current eating and workout habits, and what their goals are for the future. It was important for the user to feel engaged and have fun, without the questions being hokey. Instead of asking the user to check a box with choices about their work-life balance, for example, I created scales which the user could drag up and down. As another example, I also designed a star-rating system for users to describe which flavors they like instead of a check-all-that-apply system.</p>

          <p>A hi-fidelity mock-up was produced for mobile and desktop (pictured) versions. The Photoshop file includes basic transitions, as well, such as rollover features on the buttons. When choosing imagery, I made a conscious decision to only show glasses with juice, no plastic bottles. Key competitors' sites emphasized their plastic-bottled juice cleanses, and LiquidLab wanted to distinguish itself as separate from cleanse companies. In the Visual Design class, I presented each step of the process and guided my peers through the journey to the final design.
