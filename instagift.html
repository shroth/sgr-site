            <p>As an assigment for the UXDI course, my partner and I were tasked to diversify Instagram's revenue stream while its maintaining brand image. We had to work to add it to the existing app <span class="bold">without disrupting the current features</span> that are essential to Instagram. Our addition would enable users to customize and purchase physical versions of their photos to share with friends and family; this is otherwise known as a photo gift. </p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-10">
			<p>	
			Before conducting user research or looking at competitors, we wanted to look at Instagram's business background. We used the <span class="bold">demographic information to guide our user research</span>, so that we would interview a <span class="bold">representative mix of candidates</span>. We found that 55% of current users were 18-29 year olds, and about 65% were female.

              We also wanted to understand the current photo gift landscape so we could ask more informed questions during our user research. We analyzed other photo gift apps, some of which included integration with Instagram. We performed a <span class="bold">heuristic evaluation</span> on <a href="https://walgreens.com/" target="Walgreens">Walgreens</a>, <a href="https://snapfish.com/" target="Snapfish">Snapfish</a>, <a href="http://www.photobucket.com/" target="Photo_Bucket">Photo Bucket</a>, and <a href="http://www.socialprintstudio.com/" target="Social_Print_Studio">Social Print Studio</a>. We analyzed each competitor on several characteristics, rating each aspect on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent):
            </p>
			  <ul>
			   	  <li>Integration with Instagram</li>

              We sent out a <span class="bold">survey to recruit users who fit the demographic criteria </span> we had discovered from our business research. We spoke with users who were within the age criteria, as well as an even mix of males of females. One of the users was also a professional photographer, as we wanted to explore that viewpoint, as well. We asked users about their experience with photography and photo editing (including Instagram), their frequency of Instgram use, their experience with photo gifts, and their attitudes toward ecommerce.

              We learned that users would want to print their photos to send as gifts to family or friends, not for themselves. They do not want to hang their own photos in their homes. They want to share tokens of their shared moments. This finding would help shape our decisions about which products to offer in our design and how we framed it in the app. The feature should be a gift for others, not a standard merchandise purchase for oneself.

            <p>To help hone in on what makes a photo gift app great, we conducted a contextual inquiry with the top competitor, Snapfish. We had participants walk through photo and product selection, and walk through the purchasing process up until they had to input credit card information. We learned there were a few areas of improvement for Snapfish which we wanted to address in our design:</p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>An <span class="bold">overwhelming number</span> of product categories</li>
			    <li><span class="bold">Icons</span> on the product page were <span class="bold">confusing</span></li>

              <p>To imitate the clean cut lines and white space of Instagram, we copied components of our sketches in Illustrator and wrote the text in the program instead of by hand.

Users liked how seamless and easy to use it was: <span class="bold">"If you use Instagram, you could use this."</span> There were a few areas of improvement:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some of the icons were confusing, particularly on the product page to access the editing features</li>

		    <p>Users love Instagram's hashtags - they are fun, unique, and capture the moment. Users also liked to leave messages for photo gifts, to really make them personalized. We decided to include a text editor where you could write a message and include hashtags. We also wanted to clear up the icons so that users knew how to swap out the photo on their product, could preview it on a 360&deg; view of the product, and re-edit the photo as needed. This brought the user back to the main reason why they liked Instagram: hashtags and editing photos.</p>

We created the prototype in Sketch, and synced it in <a href="https://invis.io/VR9BRF2ZN" target="Med-Fi">Invision</a> to test with users. Thinking about the sustainability from the back-end, we wanted to limit the number of characters a message could be for each type of product. This would improve the 360&deg; preview, as well as the back-end production. </p>
